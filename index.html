<p style="font-family: 'helvetica neue'; font-size: 1.2em; color: white"> On May 31st, I left New Haven with a mix of general feeling. I wasn’t sure what happened during the past year. In the PDF we received at the end of the school year, the was a sentence that particularly got my attention “i hope you have a wonderful and productive summer.” So I started to ask to myself: what does it mean be productive? Why should I not be unproductive? Is it that bad? 

I was also struggling with this homework. I felt I was back in elementary school when by the end of the year you should have finish the book that the teacher give it to you. For this reason, I decided that instead of complaining, to do what I think I enjoy better: living my free time. I had a change to talk with old friends, eating things that I never had before, travel in country that I felt in love for first time and see new places. 

Today, I decided to open my iPhone gallery and share with you 10 images that probably mostly represent this time of “un-productive” work (which by the way to me was really productive).

I’m looking forward to work with you,
